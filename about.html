                    For as long as I can remember, technology has been a huge part of my life. I believe that technology
                    has greatly shaped
                    and inspired me to become the person I am today. This has also helped to steer me in the direction
                    of Web Design.
                    In college I started off in Computer Science. Although pursuing that degree was challenging and
                    interesting it didn't
                    seem to be the right fit. In 2022, I decided to switch to Web Design and begin my journey learning
                    about UX/UI, and have
                    been working ever since to earn my Bachelors and hopefully Masters in the future.

                    Web Design has opened me to a plethora of experiences. I had the pleasure of learning about how the
                    mind interacts with
                    technology and different types of applications across all devices. I have also learned how to apply
                    artistic and graphic
                    design techniques into the applications I make, while also sharpening my coding skills across many
                    different coding
                    languages.

                <p class="lead">
                    My experience progressing through the Web Design degree has also helped me to learn how to be a
                    leader but also a team
                    player. Collaborating on group projects and assignments in this degree has prepared me to become a
                    hard worker when it
                    comes to creating meaningful and helpful relationships in the workplace. I have learned to be strong
                    and diligent, but
                    have also learned to have empathy and work with others. I also feel that this has further helped me
                    to become flexible
                    in any situation.

                    I have great interests in all things related to pop culture, politics and literature. This helps me
                    to stay in tune
                    with what is popular which I believe greatly helps me in the graphic design aspect of Web Design. I
                    also feel that I
                    have created a portfolio that showcases an expansive knowledge of client-side and server-side
                    scripting, a skill that
                    I feel is extremely important in this field.
