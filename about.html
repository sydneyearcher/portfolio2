            <p class="lead">

                For as long as I can remember, technology has been a huge part of my life. I believe that technology has greatly shaped
                and inspired me to become the person I am today. This has also helped to steer me in the direction of Web Design. 
                In college I started off in Computer Science. Although pursuing that degree was challenging and interesting it didn't 
                seem to be the right fit. In 2022, I decided to switch to Web Design and begin my journey learning about UX/UI, and have
                been working ever since to earn my Bachelors and hopefully Masters in the future.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Web Design has opened me to a plethora of experiences. I had the pleasure of learning about how the mind interacts with
                technology and different types of applications across all devices. I have also learned how to apply artistic and graphic 
                design techniques into the applications I make, while also sharpening my coding skills across many different coding 
                languages.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                My experience progressing through the Web Design degree has also helped me to learn how to be a leader but also a team 
                player. Collaborating on group projects and assignments in this degree has prepared me to become a hard worker when it 
                comes to creating meaningful and helpful relationships in the workplace. I have learned to be strong and diligent, but 
                have also learned to have empathy and work with others. I also feel that this has further helped me to become flexible 
                in any situation. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                I have great interests in all things related to pop culture, politics and literature. This helps me to stay in tune 
                with what is popular which I believe greatly helps me in the graphic design aspect of Web Design. I also feel that I 
                have created a portfolio that showcases an expansive knowledge of client-side and server-side scripting, a skill that 
                I feel is extremely important in this field.
